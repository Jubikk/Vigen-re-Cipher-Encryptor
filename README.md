# Vigen-re-Cipher-Encryptor

Hello, My name is Joebeck Andrew F. Gusi from BSCPE 1-5.

Welcome to Vigen√®re Cipher Encryptor!! This program enables you to 
implement an algorithmic method to encrypt a message.

The program works by using a keyword as your key, which then converted into the matching letter values between 0 and 25. 
Then, in order to encrypt it, write your message on one row (letters 0 to 25), repeatedly write the keyword below it, 
add each column, and take the result as a modulo of 26. 

The user must enter their plaintext (ALL UPPERCASE LETTERS, NO SPACE)
and the keyword (ALL UPPERCASES TOO) in order for the program to generate an encrypted text.

Thank you for using my program!! <33
